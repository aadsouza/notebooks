In this notebook, we present geodetic plots that show the transatlantic flows of Ph.D. graduates' placement. We collected, extracted, and recorded data on the placements of Ph.D. graduates, including the institution where each job market candidate graduated from and the institution where they found a job along with the respective horizontal position representations (specifically latitudes and longitudes) of the institutions. We restrict our analysis to candidates that graduated in 2019 and focus on institutions with economics departments ranked in the top 100 according to rankings compiled by Tilburg University in 2016. We limit the maps to include continental North America and mainland Europe as a majority of the activity takes place across the North Atlantic.

## Maps by Applicant's Primary Field

In this section, we present the maps we created, which we organized by an applicant's primary field. We limit our analysis to the following fields i.e. subdisciplines: Development Economics, Econometrics, Finance, Industrial Organization, Labor Economics, Macroeconomics and Monetary Economics, Microeconomics, Economic Theory, Behavioral Economics, and Political Economy. The plots in red indicate that the applicants have graduated from an institution east of where they found a job. The plots in blue show that the applicants have graduated from an institution west of where they found a job. It is worth noting that plots converging in the Gulf of Guinea at the intersection of the Equator and the Prime Meridian are institutions for which we did not immediately have horizontal position representations.

## Maps by Applicant's Primary Field and Recruiter Types

In this section, we further break down the maps we saw in the previous section. For every applicants' primary field, we now include maps for each type of institution where the applicant found a job. These "types" were self-reported by the institutions which we categorize as follows: 
- Economics departments of academic organizations
- Private businesses or organizations and other types of organizations
- Government agencies or commissions
- Departments of academic organizations other than economics, business or agricultural economics
- Business schools at academic organizations

Recall that the plots in red indicate that the applicants have graduated from an institution east of where they found a job. The plots in blue indicate that the applicants have graduated from an institution west of where they found a job. It is worth noting again that plots converging in the Gulf of Guinea at the intersection of the Equator and the Prime Meridian are institutions for which we did not immediately have horizontal position representations.
